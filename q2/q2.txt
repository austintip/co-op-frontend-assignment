Question 2:

Consider the following code

setTimeout(() => {
	console.log("This is a test!");
}, 0);

someOtherFunction();

Where someOtherFunction() contains arbitrary code, which will not produce any errors or exceptions.

What is the maximum time (in milliseconds) after which the statement 

console.log("This is a test!"); 

is guaranteed to be executed? Explain the reasoning behind your answer.
