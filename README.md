This assignment was a fun challenge and learning exercise for me. I was able to implement a new section of React that I didn't know how to use before and I enjoyed adding my own personal touches to it. 
A section I was particularly fond of, although admittedly is a very simple step, was the addidtion of the gradient on the hover of the selected item. 

I enjoyed creating this library because you could truthfully make use of it with many different types of data. I plan on testing this out with some external API data at a later time so I can see how well it would work. 

I used a few separate resources for the styling. I had to look up how to use gradient again so I used this link: https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_gradients.asp
and this was for the hover selector: https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/sel_hover.asp

I had never done this sort of implementation and I had a lot of fun learning how to do it. It is always exciting learning new tricks that React has built into it.
