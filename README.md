I used a few separate resources for the styling as well. I had to look up how to use gradient again so I used this link: https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_gradients.asp

and this was for the hover selector: https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/sel_hover.asp

I had never done this sort of implementation and I had a lot of fun learning how to do it. It is always exciting learning new tricks that React has built into it.
